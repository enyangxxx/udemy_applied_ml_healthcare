Udemy Course: Applied Machine Learning For Healthcare

I will make this repository public. Although the resources have been downloaded from the Udemy course [Applied Machine Learning For Healthcare](https://www.udemy.com/course/applied-machine-learning-for-healthcare/), I set myself the goal to refine the notebooks, add my own thoughts, add my own code snippets and change things which I don't agree with.

The topics which have been dealt are:
- Breast Cancer Detection with SVM and KNN
- Heart Disease Prediction with Standard Neural Networks
- DNA Classification with multiple algorithms
- Autism Screening with Standard Neural Networks
- Diabetes Onset Detection with Standard Neural Networks
